        <h4>Acme Web Design</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <a href="acme/index.html">Visit</a>
        <p>One of my first projects, this was a practical exercise by Traversy Media on YouTube. It was my first complete website,
          using only HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4>Pricing Tables</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <a href="pricingtables/index.html">Visit</a>
        <p>Responsive pricing tables, as seen on many SaaS pages. Done using only CSS3.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4>Bookmarks</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <a href="bookmarks/index.html">Visit</a>
        <p>Done using Vanilla JavaScript. Almost no design added to it. The main purpose of this was getting familar with storage
          concepts, such as localStorage. My first experience using JSON.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4>Shopping List</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <a href="shoppinglist/index.html">Visit</a>
        <p>Similar to the Bookmarks project, this was done using Vanilla JavaScript. More DOM manipulation was added, as well
          as some styling.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4>Color Picker</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <a href="colorpicker/index.html">Visit</a>
        <p>A practical exercise of a web development course. Thus far, this has been the most DOM intensive project I have done.
          It covers a lot of the Vanilla JS DOM methods, and was the perfect project to complete before getting into jQuery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4>GitHub</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/orion-z" target="_blank">Visit</a>
        <p>My GitHub profile. You will find a lot of Vanilla JS exercises there, especially involving simple algorithms and single functions with a length of up to 40 lines, as well as several proposed solutions for exercises in "Eloquent JavaScript", a book I am reading.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4>This Webpage</h4>
        <a href="#" class="details">Details</a>
        <p>My first webpage using jQuery. It feels very easy to use and saves a lot of time, compared to Vanilla JS. I am excited
          to dive deeper into it.</p>
